# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python project for video compression using optimal libraries and techniques. The project is currently in its initial stage with only a placeholder comment in Portuguese indicating the intention to create video compression functionality.

## Environment Setup

- **Virtual Environment**: The project uses a Python virtual environment located in `venv/`
- **Python Version**: Based on venv structure, uses Python 3.13
- **Activation**: Activate the virtual environment using:
  - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` or `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
  - Unix/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

## Development Commands

Since this is a minimal Python project without package management files, standard Python commands apply:

- **Run the main script**: `python video.py`
- **Install packages**: `pip install <package_name>`
- **List installed packages**: `pip list`
- **Generate requirements**: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

## Architecture

The project currently consists of:

- `video.py` - Main entry point (currently contains only a Portuguese comment describing video compression goals)

## Key Notes

- The project aims to implement video compression using the best available libraries and techniques
- No external dependencies are currently defined
- The codebase is at the beginning stage and will likely require video processing libraries like OpenCV, FFmpeg-python, or MoviePy
- All text content is in Portuguese, suggesting the target audience is Portuguese-speaking users
